#### Game Instructions


True Believers will be given a random puzzle image that has been shuffled. Your goal is to put the pieces together in the correct order to rescue the hero. But don't take too long as you are racing against the clock. If the clock reaches zero before you've solved the puzzle, the hero is lost. You will need to rescue at least two (2) heroes in order to defeat Thanos and save Earth!

Upon the start of the game, you will pick a difficulty setting of Easy, Medium or Hard. When you place a puzzle piece in the correct location, you will hear a confirmation sound. If it is not placed in the correct location, the puzzle piece will return to its starting location.

Easy Setting:
You will have 20 seconds to solve a 9-piece puzzle.

Medium Setting:
You will have 45 seconds to solve a 16-piece puzzle.

Hard Setting:
You will have 90 seconds to solve a 25-piece puzzle.

Good Luck!
